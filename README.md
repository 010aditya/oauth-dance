OAuth Dance
===========

OAuth is a giant pain. Use this application to interact with Twitter, Github,
and Google OAuth and get yourself tokens and keys to use with their APIs.

Installation
------------

OAuth-Dance is a [Python Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) application.
Use [virtualenv](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Python-Virtualenv.md)
to run it locally. Also tested & works on Heroku.
